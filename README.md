# Avatar Syringe

A VRCFury syringe for Avatars 3.0 in VRChat!

## Dependencies

* [VRChat Creator Companion (VCC)](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/).
* [注射器（Syringe）](https://booth.pm/en/items/2501811) by 旅のよろず屋, initial release.

## Installation

1. Install [注射器（Syringe）](https://booth.pm/en/items/2501811).
2. [Add this package's listing to the VCC.](https://cassidyprather.github.io/avatar-syringe/)
3. Add this package to the project via the VCC.
4. Instantiate `Packages/Avatar Syringe/Syringe` to the location on the avatar you would like it to be held (e.g. the armature's hands). *In my example, I parented it to the right pinky finger, so I could nest the lip of the back of the syringe consistently between the fingers.*
