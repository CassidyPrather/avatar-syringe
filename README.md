# Avatar Syringe

A modular avatar syringe for Avatars 3.0 in VRChat!

## Installation

Add this package to VCC.
Drag and drop the syringe to the location on the avatar you would like it to be held (e.g. the armature's hands).
Optionally edit the "grasping" anmiation; the default does not play nice with all hand proportions.

## Dependencies

* Liltoon (??? why isn't this in VPM)
* VRCFury ???
